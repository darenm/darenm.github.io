Hi my name is Daren May,

I've always been a developer at heart, although my first profession was as an aviation engineer in the British Royal Navy. I have owned and operated a number of consulting companies - currently I am founder and president of CustomMayd. We design and create developer training and develop Xbox, mobile, desktop and web software for a variety of clients, both small and large. My personal passion is Windows development using UWP and the composition APIs. I love sharing my experience and passion for technologies and often present to local user groups as well as creating training for Microsoft Learn, edX and recording training sessions for Microsoft's Virtual Academy.

In my leisure time I exercise with [Manic Training](https://manictraining.com/location/highlands-ranch-co/), read, as well as hike, camp and ride my motorcycles in the Colorado mountains.
